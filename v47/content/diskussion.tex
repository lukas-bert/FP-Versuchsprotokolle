The measured heat capacity plotted in \autoref{fig:plot} shows increasing values for both $C_{\symup{P}}$ and $C_{\symup{V}}$ but the slope is 
not monotonically increasing. There are many saltus in the graph. This can be explained with a low quantity of data but badly adjusted temperature for
the outer coil could also be a reason for that.

The Debye temperature is measured as $\theta_{\symup{D, exp}} = \qty{301.73 +- 56.29}{\kelvin}$ in the experiment but calculated to 
be $\theta_{\symup{D, theo}} = \qty{332.18}{\kelvin}$. This is a deviation of $\qty{9.17}{\percent}$, calculated with
\begin{equation*}
    \symup{\Delta_\text{rel.}}(\theta_{\symup{D}}) = \frac{|\theta_{\symup{D, theo}} - \theta_{\symup{D, exp}}|}{\theta_{\symup{D, theo}}}.
\end{equation*}

The high uncertainty in the measured Debye temperature can be explained with the scattered data for the heat capacity. The looking up data in the given tables
is also not that precise and can therefore lead to uncertainties in the data.
